# Ray Tracing
This code implements recursive ray tracing with the following features:

1. A scene with objects of the type: polygon (plane), and sphere. One can also specift the material and geometric properties. 
2. Local illumination model with diffuse, specular and ambient components.
3. Multiple light sources.
4. Global illumination with reflection, refraction and shadows.
5. Anti-aliasing using supersampling.
6. Input using a file in format defined in the file inputformat.txt
7. Specify eye/camera in viewing coordinate system as done in the viewing pipe line.
